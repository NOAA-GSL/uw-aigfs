# Contributor Guide

[← Back to Index](index.md)

Welcome to the ***uw-aigfs*** Contributor Guide. Please familiarize yourself with and follow the procedures in the sections below before submitting changes.

> **Note:** Before starting work on a new feature, bug fix, or other change, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/NOAA-GSL/uw-aigfs/issues) to propose your change and solicit feedback from other developers. This helps avoid duplicate efforts or wasted work.

## Developer Setup

> **Note:** The installation of conda environments is only meant for systems other than WCOSS2.

***uw-aigfs*** installs and manages its own conda installation in the `conda/` subdirectory of the repository root. To set up a development environment, run:

```bash
make devenv
```

This installs [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) into `conda/`, creates the `aigfs` conda environment from `environment.yml`, and then installs additional developer tools (linters, formatters, test runners) listed in `devpkgs`.

After the initial installation, activate the environment in a fresh shell with:

```bash
source load_wflow_modules.sh <platform>
```

where `<platform>` is `ursa` or `wcoss2` (see the [User Guide](user_guide.md#setting-up-the-environment) for details).

> **Note on disk space:** The conda installation requires several gigabytes of disk space. Clone `uw-aigfs` to a location with a sufficiently large disk quota — not your HPC home directory.

## Code Quality

Several `make` targets are available in an activated `aigfs` development environment:

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `make format` | Format Python code with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) |
| `make lint` | Lint Python code with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) |
| `make test` | Run the linter and unit tests (`lint` + `unittest`) |
| `make unittest` | Run unit tests and report coverage with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) |

Configuration for `ruff` and `pytest` is provided by `pyproject.toml` in the repository root.

A useful development idiom is:

```bash
make format && make test
```

This formats the code, then runs the linter and unit tests. The order is intentional:

- **`format`** catches certain syntax errors that would cause other tools to fail (and could change line numbers in their reports).
- **`lint`** provides a fast first check for obvious errors and anti-patterns.
- **`unittest`** runs higher-level semantic-correctness checks once syntax is clean.

All checks are run by CI against every pull request. Ensure your code is formatted and tests pass locally before opening a PR.

### Formatting and Linting

`ruff` is configured with a line length of 100 characters and a broad rule set (see `pyproject.toml` for the full list of enabled and disabled rules). To check and auto-fix formatting:

```bash
make format
```

To check for lint errors without fixing:

```bash
make lint
```

### Unit Tests

Unit tests live in the `tests/` directory. Run them with coverage reporting:

```bash
make unittest
```

Tests are run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and coverage is reported via [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/). All pull requests must have passing tests. Strive to maintain high test coverage for any new code you add.

## Fork and PR Model

### Overview

Contributions to `uw-aigfs` are made via a [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) and [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) model. The general steps are:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project#forking-a-repository) the [uw-aigfs repository](https://github.com/NOAA-GSL/uw-aigfs) into your personal GitHub account.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) your fork onto your development system.
3. [Create an Issue](https://github.com/NOAA-GSL/uw-aigfs/issues/new) to discuss your proposed change before starting work.
4. [Create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project#creating-a-branch-to-work-on) in your clone for your changes.
5. [Make, commit, and push changes](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project#making-and-pushing-changes) in your clone to your fork. Refer to the [Developer Setup](#developer-setup) section for formatting and testing instructions.
6. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project#making-a-pull-request) to merge your changes into the main repository.

For future contributions, either delete and recreate your fork, or configure the official `uw-aigfs` repository as a [remote](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-repository-for-a-fork) and [sync upstream changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) to stay up-to-date.

### Specifics for uw-aigfs

When creating your PR, please follow these guidelines:

- Target base repository `NOAA-GSL/uw-aigfs` and base branch `main`.
- Complete the PR description template. Provide an informative summary of your contribution and mark the appropriate checklist items.
- Initially open your PR as a [draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests).
- Visit the _Files changed_ tab and add inline comments on lines you think reviewers will benefit from. Proactively answering anticipated questions saves review time.
- Once your draft is marked up, click _Ready for review_ on the _Conversation_ tab.

A default set of reviewers will be added automatically. You may add others if appropriate. Respond to reviewer comments as needed, pushing additional commits to your branch. Your PR will update automatically.

### Merging

Your PR is ready to merge when:

1. It has been approved by a required number of `uw-aigfs` core-developer reviewers.
2. All required CI checks have passed.

These criteria and their current statuses are shown at the bottom of the PR's _Conversation_ tab. CI checks take some time to run — please be patient.

If you have write access to the repository, you may merge your PR yourself once the above conditions are met. Otherwise, a core developer will merge it for you.

### Need Help?

Use the _Conversation_ tab of your PR to ask for help with any difficulties you encounter during the contribution process.

### Key Concepts

**Drivers** (`drivers/`) implement [uwtools](https://uwtools.readthedocs.io/en/main/) driver classes using the [iotaa](https://github.com/maddenp/iotaa) task framework. Each driver exposes tasks (Python methods decorated with `@task`, `@collection`, or `@external`) that declare their inputs and outputs as `Asset` objects. The `uw execute` command (called from ***Rocoto*** job scripts) resolves and runs these tasks.

**Configuration** follows the ***uwtools*** YAML model. `ush/default_config.yaml` is the baseline; it is merged with the machine YAML and any user-provided YAMLs by `ush/generate_experiment.py` using `uwtools.api.config.compose`. The resulting `experiment.yaml` is the single source of truth at runtime.

**Workflow** is managed by [Rocoto](https://github.com/christopherwharrop/rocoto). The `parm/wflow/rocoto/aigfs_base.yaml` template is realized by ***uwtools*** to produce `rocoto.xml`. Task dependencies (prep → forecast → post) are expressed in that template.

When adding a new workflow stage, you will typically need to:

1. Add a new driver class in `drivers/`.
2. Add corresponding configuration blocks in `ush/default_config.yaml`.
3. Add a new task or metatask entry in `parm/wflow/rocoto/aigfs_base.yaml`.
4. Add unit tests in `tests/drivers/`.
5. Update this documentation.
